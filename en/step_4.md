## Collect examples for your machine learning model

--- task ---
+ Close the Scratch window and go back to the Training tool.

+ Click on the **< Back to project** link.
--- /task ---

--- task ---
+ We need to collect some examples to train the computer. Click the **Train** button.
![Project main menu](images/train-model.png)

+ Click on **+ Add new label** and call it “kind things”.  Do that again, and create a second bucket called “mean things”. 
![2 empty classes named kind_things and mean_things](images/kind-and-mean.png)

+ Click on the **Add example** button in the “kind things” bucket, and type in the nicest, kindest compliment you can think of. 

+ Click on the **Add example** button in the “mean things” bucket, and type in a meanest, cruellest insult you can think of.

+ Continue to **Add example**s until you have got at least **six** compliments and **six** insults.

title: Tips for selecting good examples

+ **More examples!**: The more examples you give it, the better the computer should get at recognising whether a message is kind or mean. 

+ **Try and be even**: Try and come up with roughly the same number of examples for kind and mean. If you have a lot of examples for one type, and not the other, the computer might learn that type is more likely, so you’ll affect the way that it learns to recognise messages. 

+ **Mix things up with your examples**: Try to come up with lots of different types of examples. For example, make sure that you include some long examples and some very short ones.

In the next step you will train your machine to recognise whether your message is a compliment or an insult and automatically put it in one of the 2 buckets based on the examples you have added.

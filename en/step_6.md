+ Click on the **Code** tab, and update the script to use your machine learning model **instead** of the rules you made before.
The “recognise text … (label)” block is a new block added by your project. If you give it text, it will return return either "kind things" or "mean things" based on the training you’ve given to the computer.
You can use this to choose the costume to switch to.

+ Test your project 
Type a kind message and press enter. The character should smile.
Click the green flag again. Type a mean and unkind message and press enter. The character should look sad. 
Make sure you test that this works **even for messages that you didn’t include in your training.**

You’ve modified your Scratch character to use machine learning instead of your earlier rules-based approach.
Training the computer to be able to recognise messages for itself should be much quicker than trying to make a list of every possible message.
The more examples you give it, the better it should get at recognising messages correctly.
